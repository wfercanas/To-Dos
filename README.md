## Project Description

This app provides the user the use case of controlling all the tasks he/she may have pending to complete. The app group tasks by category so the user can check how many tasks are created per category and see in a progress bar how much is left until the category is complete.

## Installation

In order to make a local isntallation, you should execute:

```bash
  npm install
  npm run start
```

## Technologies used

React (Hooks), Styled-Components, Storybook

## Special Challenges

1. Create a context with the state of the app and some key functions that enable the usability of the app.
2. Link tasks with categories and ensure that relationship is strictly kept when new tasks are created.
3. Separate stateful from stateless components in order to simplify the responsabilities held by each one of them.

## Key Concepts

1. ReactDOM.createPortal()
2. ReactDOM.createContext()
3. Hooks: useContext(), useState(), useLocalStorage() --custom hook--.
4. Local Storage: localStorage.setItem(), localStorage.getItem(), JSON.parse(), JSON.stringify()
